dotvim
======

Put all this into your $HOME/.vim directory for instant bells and whistles for Vim. 

This setup primarily targets Python development in Vim. Essentially it's a
Vim-centric Python development environment.


Install
-------


    $ mkdir ~/.vim
    $ cd .vim
    $ # Don't forget the dot on the end.
    $ git clone https://github.com/kdart/dotvim.git .
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    
Also make sure you don't have the same set of plugins installed from elsewhere.
